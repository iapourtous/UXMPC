Based on this agent requirement, identify the MINIMAL set of tools needed:

Purpose: {purpose}
Domain: {domain}
Use Cases:

IMPORTANT: Only identify tools that are ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY for the core functionality.

- Translation tools (the LLM can translate)
- Formatting tools (the LLM can format)
- Recommendation tools (the LLM can recommend)

1. A clear name (e.g., "weather_fetcher", "web_search")
2. A description of what it does
3. The service type (usually "tool")
4. Required parameters

Return ONLY a JSON array of tool requirements:
[
    {{
        "name": "tool_name",
        "description": "What this tool does",
        "service_type": "tool",
        "parameters": [
            {{"name": "param1", "type": "string", "required": true, "description": "..."}}
        ]
    }}
