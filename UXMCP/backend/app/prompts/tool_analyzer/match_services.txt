Match required tools with existing services in the system.

Required Tools:
{required_tools}

Available Services:
{available_services}

For each required tool:
1. Find the BEST matching existing service (if any)
2. Consider partial matches and similar functionality
3. Assess compatibility (0-100%)
4. Note any missing features

Be generous in matching - if a service can potentially fulfill the need with minor adaptation, match it!

Return JSON with matches and analysis:

            "compatibility": 85,
