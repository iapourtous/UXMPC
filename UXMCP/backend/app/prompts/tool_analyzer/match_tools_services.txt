Match the required tools with existing services. Be flexible with naming but strict with functionality.

Required Tools:
{required_tools}

Available Services (including inactive ones that can be activated):
{available_services}

For each required tool, determine if any existing service can fulfill its purpose.
Consider:
1. Functional equivalence (does it do what we need?)
2. Parameter compatibility (can we provide required inputs?)
3. Output compatibility (does it return useful data?)
4. Inactive services can be activated if they match

Return ONLY a JSON object mapping required tool names to service IDs (or null if no match):
{{
    "tool_name_1": "service_id_or_null",
    "tool_name_2": "service_id_or_null",
    ...
}}
