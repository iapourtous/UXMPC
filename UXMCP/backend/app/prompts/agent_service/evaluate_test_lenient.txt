Evaluate this test result:

Test Case: {test_description}
Input Parameters: {input_params}
Expected Output: {expected_output}

Actual Result:
- Success: {actual_success}
- Response: {actual_response}
- Error: {actual_error}

Does the actual result match the expected output? Be LENIENT in your evaluation:

IMPORTANT EVALUATION RULES:
1. If the service returned success=true and has data, consider it PASSED
2. For external API services (like NewsAPI), accept ANY valid response format
3. Don't fail tests for minor differences like:
   - Different number of results than expected
   - Additional fields in the response
   - Different content in articles (for news APIs)
   - Timestamps or dynamic values
4. ONLY fail if:
   - The service returns an error (success=false)
   - The service crashes or times out
   - Required fields are completely missing
   - The response structure is completely wrong

BE LENIENT - if the service works and returns data, it should PASS!

Return ONLY a JSON object:
{{
    "passed": true/false,
    "reason": "Why it passed or failed",
    "issues": ["list", "of", "specific", "issues"],
    "suggestions": ["list", "of", "fixes", "to", "try"]
}}
