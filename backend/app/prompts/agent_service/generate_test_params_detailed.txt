Based on this service definition, generate appropriate test parameters:

Service Name: {service_name}
Description: {description}
Route: {route}
Method: {method}
Service Type: {service_type}

Parameters:
{parameters}

Generate realistic test values that would properly test this service. Consider:
- The service name and description to understand what it does
- Parameter names and types
- Required vs optional parameters
- Realistic values that would actually work
- Keep it simple - avoid complex objects for initial tests

IMPORTANT RULES:
1. For URL parameters, use simple, well-known URLs like "example.com" or "google.com" (without https://)
2. For optional object parameters like headers, omit them for the initial test
3. Keep numbers reasonable (e.g., timeout: 10)
4. Keep booleans simple (true/false)

Return ONLY a JSON object with parameter names as keys and test values as values.
For example: {{"url": "example.com", "timeout": 10}}
