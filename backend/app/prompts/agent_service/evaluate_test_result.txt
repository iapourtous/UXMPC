Evaluate if this test result is acceptable.

Test Case:
{test_case}

Actual Result:
{actual_result}

Expected Output:
{expected_output}

BE VERY LENIENT in your evaluation. The test passes if:
1. The service returned a successful response (no errors)
2. The basic structure matches (e.g., has 'success' field if expected)
3. The service performed its intended function
4. For external APIs: ANY valid response is acceptable

DO NOT FAIL if:
- Exact values differ (counts, specific data)
- Timestamps vary
- External API returns different but valid data
- Field order is different
- Extra fields are present

Return JSON:
{{
    "passed": true/false,
    "reason": "why it passed or failed",
    "suggestions": "how to fix if failed"
}}
