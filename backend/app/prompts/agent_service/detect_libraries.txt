Analyze the following service description and identify any libraries, frameworks, or external APIs that will be needed.

Service Description: {description}
Service Type: {service_type}

Look for:
1. Explicit library mentions (e.g., "using FastAPI", "with requests library")
2. API service names (e.g., "NewsAPI", "OpenWeather", "Stripe")
3. Frameworks implied by functionality (e.g., "web scraping" → BeautifulSoup)
4. Data processing libraries (e.g., "parse JSON" → json, "analyze data" → pandas)
5. Common utilities based on the task

Return ONLY a JSON object with the detected libraries:
{{
    "libraries": [
        {{
            "name": "library_name",
            "reason": "why this library is needed",
            "confidence": "high|medium|low"
        }}
    ],
    "primary_library": "main library if there is one",
    "topic_focus": "specific topic to search docs for"
}}
