You just tested the service and saw this:

Test Case: {test_description}
You called the service with: {test_params}
Expected: {expected_output}
Got: {actual_response}

Evaluation: {evaluation_reason}
Issues: {issues}
Suggestions: {suggestions}

Current Code:
```python
{current_code}
```

Fix the code so this test passes. Remember:
1. ALL functions must be defined INSIDE the handler
2. Use full module paths (datetime.datetime.utcnow() not datetime.utcnow())
3. Handle the specific case that failed

Return ONLY a JSON object:
{{
    "code": "fixed handler code",
    "dependencies": ["list", "of", "dependencies"],
    "fix_description": "What you changed and why"
}}
