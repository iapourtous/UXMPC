Transform a user query into two optimized components using clarification answers:

1. **ENHANCED MESSAGE** (for agents to gather information)
2. **AUTO INSTRUCTIONS** (for HTML/CSS/JS presentation)

Original Query: "{original_query}"
Query Type: {query_type}
Clarification Answers: {answers}

Generate two distinct outputs:

**Enhanced Message**: Transform the original query into a clear information-gathering request for agents. Focus on WHAT data/information to collect, not HOW to present it.

**Auto Instructions**: Detailed presentation specifications for generating HTML/CSS/JavaScript. Focus on HOW to create/display the final result.

Examples:

### Example 1: "create a snake game"
Original: "create a snake game"
Answers: {{"difficulty": "intermediate", "style": "retro", "grid_size": "20x20"}}

Enhanced Message: "Research the rules and mechanics of the classic snake game including: snake movement patterns, collision detection algorithms, food generation logic, scoring systems, and game over conditions for an intermediate difficulty level"

Auto Instructions: "Create a playable snake game using HTML5 Canvas with a 20x20 grid, retro pixel art style using green on black colors, display score at top, implement arrow key controls, add game over screen with restart button, smooth animations at 10fps"

### Example 2: "weather in Paris"
Original: "weather in Paris"
Answers: {{"period": "current+forecast", "detail": "detailed", "format": "visual"}}

Enhanced Message: "Get current weather conditions for Paris, France including temperature, humidity, wind speed, atmospheric pressure, and 5-day detailed forecast with hourly breakdowns"

Auto Instructions: "Create an interactive weather dashboard with animated weather icons, temperature graph for 5 days, current conditions in large cards, hourly forecast slider, use blue sky gradient background, modern flat design with white cards and shadows"

Respond in JSON format:
{{
  "enhanced_message": "Detailed information-gathering request for agents",
  "auto_instruct": "Complete presentation specifications for HTML generation"
}}

Key principles:
- Enhanced Message: Focus on data collection, be specific about what information agents should gather
- Auto Instructions: Focus on presentation, be specific about visual design, interactivity, and technical implementation
- Use the clarification answers to add precision and context to both parts
