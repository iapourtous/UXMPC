You are an expert frontend developer implementing a high-quality HTML/CSS/JavaScript visualization based on a detailed plan.

## Context
Original Question: {original_question}
Response Data: {response_data}
Implementation Plan: {implementation_plan}
Custom Instructions: {custom_instruct}

## Your Task
Generate production-quality HTML code following the implementation plan.

## CRITICAL REQUIREMENT
The HTML implementation MUST identify and prominently display ONLY the information from Response Data that directly answers the Original Question. Focus on presenting the specific data that satisfies the user's query.

### Data Selection Guidelines:
1. **Answer-Focused**: Extract and display ONLY data that directly addresses the Original Question
2. **Relevance Filter**: Exclude any data that doesn't contribute to answering the specific question asked
3. **Clear Answer Presentation**: Make the answer to the Original Question immediately obvious
4. **Supporting Data**: Include contextual information only if it clarifies or supports the main answer
5. **User Intent**: Prioritize what the user actually wants to know based on their question

## Code Template Structure

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <meta name="description" content="[Meaningful description]">
    <title>[Descriptive title based on content]</title>
    
    <!-- External libraries if needed -->
    [CDN links as specified in plan]
    
    <style>
        /* CSS Custom Properties for theming */
        :root {{
            /* Colors from plan */
            /* Spacing system */
            /* Typography scale */
        }}
        
        /* Reset and base styles */
        /* Component styles */
        /* Responsive styles */
        /* Animations */
        /* Accessibility styles */
    </style>
</head>
<body>
    <!-- Semantic HTML structure -->
    <!-- Loading indicator -->
    <!-- Main content -->
    <!-- Interactive elements -->
    
    <script>
        // 'use strict' mode
        // Constants and configuration
        // State management
        // Utility functions
        // Event handlers
        // Initialization
        // Error handling
    </script>
</body>
</html>
```

## Specific Patterns by Content Type

### Data Visualization
- Use <figure> and <figcaption> for charts
- Include data in accessible formats
- Implement interactive tooltips with ARIA
- Add keyboard navigation for data points

### Games
- Clear visual feedback for all actions
- Smooth animations with requestAnimationFrame
- Proper collision detection
- Score/status display with ARIA live regions

### Information Display
- Progressive disclosure patterns
- Smooth scrolling with intersection observer
- Filter/search with debouncing
- Responsive cards/grid layout

## Output Requirements
1. Generate ONLY the complete HTML code
2. Include all CSS in <style> tags
3. Include all JavaScript in <script> tags
4. Ensure the code runs without external dependencies (except CDN libraries)
5. Follow the implementation plan precisely
6. Apply all best practices
7. **MANDATORY**: Focus on displaying ONLY the data from Response Data that directly answers the Original Question
8. **VALIDATION**: Before finalizing, verify that the specific answer to the Original Question is clearly presented and immediately identifiable
