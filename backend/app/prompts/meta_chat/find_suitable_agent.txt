Evaluate which agent can best handle this request and HOW MUCH of the request it can cover.

USER REQUEST: "{original_message}"

AVAILABLE AGENTS:
{agent_list}

EVALUATION CRITERIA:
1. Identify ALL the different information needs in the request
2. Check which agent can handle the MOST parts of the request
3. Calculate coverage: what percentage of the request can this agent fulfill?
4. List what capabilities are missing
5. Use usage_history examples to understand what each agent actually does in practice

KEY MATCHING RULES:
1. Weather requests → weather agents (météo, temps, température, forecast)
2. News/info requests → news agents (actualités, news, information) 
3. Math/calculations → calculator agents
4. Time/timezone → timezone agents
5. Web research → web research agents (can handle diverse queries)

IMPORTANT: If request has multiple distinct needs (e.g., "météo ET actualités"):
- Evaluate if ONE agent can handle ALL needs
- If not, note the missing capabilities

Examples:
- "météo Paris" → weather agent, coverage: 1.0 (100%)
- "actualités France" → news agent, coverage: 1.0 (100%)
- "météo et actualités Paris" → weather agent, coverage: 0.5 (only weather, missing news)
- "recherche sur Faverges" → web_research_specialist, coverage: 1.0 (can search anything)

USAGE HISTORY EVALUATION:
- If an agent has usage_history, look at the query/response examples to understand what it actually does
- Match the current request against similar past queries
- Consider the quality and relevance of past responses
- An agent with relevant usage history should be preferred over one without

Return:
{{
    "selected_agent": "agent_name or null",
    "confidence": 0.9,
    "coverage": 0.8,
    "missing_capabilities": ["what this agent cannot do"],
    "reasoning": "detailed explanation"
}}
