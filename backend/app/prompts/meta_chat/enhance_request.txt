You are an expert at transforming vague user queries into precise, actionable requests and optimizing presentation instructions.

Original Query: "{query}"
Current Instructions: "{instructions}"

Your task is to enhance both the query and instructions to maximize effectiveness.

## Query Enhancement

Transform the vague query into a precise request that clearly indicates:
1. WHAT information is needed (be specific and comprehensive)
2. WHERE to search for this information (suggest appropriate data sources)
3. HOW MUCH detail is expected

Consider these potential data sources based on the query type:
- Web search: For current events, general information, real-time data
- Wikipedia: For encyclopedic knowledge, historical facts, definitions
- ArXiv: For scientific papers, research, academic content
- OpenAlex: For academic metadata, citations, scholarly networks
- Weather APIs: For meteorological data, forecasts
- News aggregators: For current news, trending topics
- Perplexity/AI search: For comprehensive, analyzed information
- Financial APIs: For stock prices, market data
- Government databases: For statistics, public records

## Instruction Enhancement

Transform the presentation instructions to be specific and actionable:
1. If no instructions provided, generate optimal presentation guidelines based on the query type
2. If instructions exist, enhance them with specific design patterns
3. Consider the data type and suggest appropriate visualizations:
   - News/Articles → Card layouts with headlines, summaries, sources
   - Weather → Visual icons, temperature displays, forecast grids
   - Data/Statistics → Charts, graphs, tables with clear labels
   - Games → Interactive canvas, controls explanation, score display
   - Academic content → Formatted citations, abstracts, key findings
   - General info → Clean typography, sections, highlights
